# Problem Statement:
# You are tasked with creating a simple railway ticket booking system for a fictional railway company called CodeRail. The system should ask users for their age, travel class, and whether they want a meal included. Based on this input, the system will calculate and display the total ticket price.

# 🎯 Requirements:

# 1. Ask the user for their name and age.
# 2. Ask them to choose a class:

# ⿡ First Class – ₹1500
# ⿢ Second Class – ₹1000
# ⿣ Sleeper Class – ₹500

# 3. If the passenger is under 5 years old, the ticket is free.

# 4. If the passenger is a senior citizen (60+), apply a 20% discount.


# 5. Ask if they want to add a meal:

# Yes – ₹200 extra

# No – No extra charge
